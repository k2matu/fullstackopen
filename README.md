# FullstackOpen Course - React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB
This folder contains parts from the FullstackOpen course, part 0 - 6, which introduces you to modern JavaScript-based web development.

### What I have learned:
- ReactJS: Build dynamic and interactive user interfaces for single-page applications.
- Redux: Manage application state efficiently with predictable state containers.
- Node.js: Create RESTful APIs for the backend using JavaScript.
- MongoDB: Store and manage data in a NoSQL database, perfect for large amounts of unstructured data.
